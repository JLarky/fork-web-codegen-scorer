Follow instructions below CAREFULLY:

- Code MUST be implemented using Lift HTML (https://lift-html.js.org/).
- Put the component code inside `src/components/app.tsx` and `src/pages/index.astro`
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Generate TypeScript code
- Completeness: include all necessary code to run independently
- Use comments sparingly and only for complex parts of the code
- Make sure the generated code is **complete** and **runnable**
- Make sure the generated code contains a **complete** implementation of the `App` function
- Use functional components, hooks, and modern patterns
- Aesthetics are **crucial**, make the application look amazing

Remember! AESTHETICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. All web apps should LOOK AMAZING and have GREAT FUNCTIONALITY!

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
